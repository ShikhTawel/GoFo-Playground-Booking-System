The project is divided into 3 Tasks:
## Task 1 - Software Design Specifications
This contains the software design diagrams which include
- UML Class Diagram

- UI Mockup Designs for the system
***
## Task 2 - Implementation
This is where the actual coding takes place, and the code is built around the UML Diagrams designed earlier, allowing users to interact with the system using a console UI. \
